## 🔧 Automation Scripts

### Dynamic Pricing Engine
```python
class DynamicPricing:
    def __init__(self, base_price, min_margin=0.2):
        self.base_price = base_price
        self.min_margin = min_margin
        
    def calculate_optimal_price(self, demand_score, competitor_prices, inventory_level):
        # Demand-based adjustment
        demand_multiplier = 1 + (demand_score - 0.5) * 0.3
        
        # Competitor positioning
        avg_competitor = sum(competitor_prices) / len(competitor_prices)
        price_adjustment = min(0.15, (avg_competitor - self.base_price) / self.base_price)
        
        # Inventory pressure
        inventory_multiplier = 1.0
        if inventory_level < 0.1:  # Low stock
            inventory_multiplier = 1.1  # Raise price
        elif inventory_level > 0.8:  # High stock
            inventory_multiplier = 0.95  # Lower price
            
        optimal_price = self.base_price * demand_multiplier * (1 + price_adjustment) * inventory_multiplier
        
        # Ensure minimum margin
        cost = self.base_price * (1 - self.min_margin)
        return max(optimal_price, cost)
```

### Inventory Forecasting
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

class InventoryForecaster:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = LinearRegression()
        
    def train(self, historical_sales, features):
        """Train on historical sales data"""
        X = np.array(features)  # [day_of_week, month, promotions, etc.]
        y = np.array(historical_sales)
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        
    def forecast_demand(self, future_features, days=30):
        """Forecast demand for next N days"""
        forecasts = []
        for day_features in future_features:
            prediction = self.model.predict([day_features])[0]
            forecasts.append(max(0, int(prediction)))
        return forecasts
    
    def calculate_reorder_point(self, lead_time_days, safety_stock_days=7):
        """Calculate optimal reorder point"""
        daily_forecasts = self.forecast_demand([])
        avg_daily_demand = sum(daily_forecasts) / len(daily_forecasts)
        
        reorder_point = (avg_daily_demand * lead_time_days) + (avg_daily_demand * safety_stock_days)
        return int(reorder_point)
```
